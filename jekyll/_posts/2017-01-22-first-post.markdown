2017 is a new year for a new me. I thought - why not start a blog as my New Year's resolution. For the rest of the year, I am committing to posting once a week.

JK lol. New Years resolutions are for chumps. While this will likely be dead in two weeks, I would like to give it some purpose. I dabble in fairly pretentious hobbies and work in a field with a lot of snooty people. I often find myself pressured into pretending that I know everything... until eventually I do. However, there are little things in every practice that intermediates or experts just take for granted, most of which people starting out are too afraid to ask about because they're afraid of the emotionally crippling condescension that could ensue. 

I'd like to dedicate this blog to answering "dumb" questions - because nothing is too hard to learn, and often times, those "dumb" questions are the only barrier to entry that keep people from actually doing it. 

When I started out programming, I wouldn't ever venture outside of an IDE (what even is that? -- stay tuned!) because the command line (blandly colored box with blander text that executes instructions) looked like black magic, and I couldn't find a green triangle in my plain text editor to run programs (WTF Notepad!?). 

Things like that - often explained in 2 hour Youtube videos ([See Reference][quickbooks-pro]) - are what have inhibited me from beginning to learn new skills in the past, and likely in the future. In summary, I aim for this blog to be the Google instant results for "dumb questions".
